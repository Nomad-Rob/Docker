This will show how to do Multiple Containers for a project

## Requirements
- Docker application installed on your host machine
- Docker account
- Docker Compose installed
- IDE (VSCode or whatever you prefer)
- Makefile extensions (optional) but used in this repo

## Docker Compose
This file will show how to run multiple containers with docker compose. Docker compose is a tool that allows you to run multiple containers at once. This is useful if you have an application that requires multiple containers to run. For example if you have a web application that requires a database and a web server. You can use docker compose to run both containers at once. This will allow you to run your application locally without having to deploy it to a server. This is useful for testing and development purposes.

# Docker Compose Configuration Explanation

This Docker Compose file is designed to create a multi-container Docker application with three main services: `frontend`, `backend`, and `database`. Each service is configured to meet specific requirements of a typical web application stack.

## Services Overview

### Frontend Service
- **Build Context and Environment**: The frontend service is built using the Dockerfile in the `./frontend` directory. The build argument `NODE_ENV` is set to `development`, indicating that the build context is for development purposes.
- **Port Mapping**: The service is configured to expose port 5173 on both the host and the container, allowing access to the frontend application.
- **Volumes**: A volume is mapped from the host's `./frontend` directory to `/app` in the container. This allows for live updating of the frontend code without needing to rebuild the image.
- **Restart Policy**: The service uses `unless-stopped` as its restart policy, meaning it will always restart unless explicitly stopped by the user.

### Backend Service
- **Build Context and Environment**: Similar to the frontend, the backend service uses the Dockerfile in the `./backend` directory with `NODE_ENV` set to `development`.
- **Port Mapping**: Port 3001 is exposed on both the host and the container for backend service access.
- **Volumes**: The `./backend` directory on the host is mapped to `/app` in the container, enabling live code updates.
- **Restart Policy**: The backend service also restarts automatically unless it's manually stopped.

### Database Service
- **Environment Variables**: The database service, using the `postgres:latest` image, is configured with environment variables for setting up the Postgres user, password, and database name.
- **Port Mapping**: Port 5432 is exposed, allowing database access from the host.
- **Volumes**: The `./pg_data` directory on the host is mapped to `/var/lib/postgresql/data` in the container. This mapping ensures data persistence across container restarts.
- **Restart Policy**: The database service will automatically restart unless stopped.

## Understanding Docker Volumes
## Docker Volumes

Docker volumes are used for managing persistent data generated by and used by Docker containers. Here are key points about Docker volumes:

### Data Persistence

Volumes provide a way to persist data generated by and used by Docker containers. When containers are removed, the volume remains intact.

### Data Sharing

Volumes can be shared and reused among multiple containers. They allow you to share data between a container and the host machine.

### Storage Independence

Volumes are managed outside the lifecycle of a container, making them a reliable choice for storing data. They are stored in a part of the host filesystem which is managed by Docker (/var/lib/docker/volumes/ on Linux).

### Non-Docker Processes

Data in volumes is accessible to non-Docker processes, meaning you can use system tools to manipulate them.

### Types of Volumes

- Named Volumes: Identified by a name and easier to work with.
- Anonymous Volumes: Created without a name and identified by their ID.

### Use Cases

- Ideal for storing database files, configurations, large datasets, and logs.
- Useful for applications that need to save state, like WordPress or MySQL.

### Volume Drivers

Docker supports multiple volume drivers, allowing volumes to be hosted on remote hosts or cloud providers. Drivers can be specified when creating a volume.

### Backup and Migration

Volumes can be backed up or moved from one machine to another, providing flexibility for data management.

### Performance

They offer better performance for storing and accessing data compared to bind mounts.

### Security

Docker volumes are more secure than bind mounts as they donâ€™t allow direct access to the host file system.
